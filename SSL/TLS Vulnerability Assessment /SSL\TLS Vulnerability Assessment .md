# SSL/TLS Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Date:** 04 November 2025  
**Analyst:** AADITH C H  
**Target Domain:** badssl.com  

---

## 1.  Summary

A security scan was performed on **badssl.com (104.154.89.105)** to identify vulnerabilities in its SSL/TLS configuration.  
The scan identified two high-risk vulnerabilities:

- **Support for Outdated Protocols:** The server supports the deprecated TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols.  
- **Support for Weak Ciphers:** The server supports 3DES ciphers, making it vulnerable to the SWEET32 attack.

These misconfigurations expose the server and its users to **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** and **data decryption attacks**.  
This report details these findings, their impacts, and the required mitigation strategies.

## 2. Methodology

The assessment was conducted using the **Nmap network scanner** and its **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** to actively probe the target's HTTPS port.

- **Tool:** Nmap v7.94svn  
- **Command:**  
  ```bash
  nmap -sV -p 443 --script ssl-cert,ssl-enum-ciphers badssl.com
  ```  
- **Identification Method:**  
  - The `ssl-cert` script was used to analyze the public certificate.  
  - The `ssl-enum-ciphers` script was used to enumerate all supported protocols and cipher suites.

## 3. Findings and Recommendations

### 🔹 Finding 1: Support for Deprecated TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1

**Identification:**  
The Nmap scan output clearly shows that **TLSv1.0** and **TLSv1.1** are enabled and offering cipher suites.

**Evidence Screenshot:**

*This screenshot clearly shows the `TLSv1.0:` and `TLSv1.1:` sections.*

**Impact (High Risk):**  
These protocols are obsolete and have known cryptographic weaknesses.  
Their use makes the connection susceptible to **downgrade attacks**, where an attacker can force a user's browser to connect using these weaker protocols, enabling attacks like **BEAST** and **POODLE** to decrypt sensitive information.

**Root Cause:**  
The server's SSL/TLS configuration has not been hardened to disable these end-of-life protocols.

**Mitigation Strategy:**  
Update the web server configuration (e.g., `ssl_protocols` in Nginx or `SSLProtocol` in Apache) to disable support for TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1.  
Only modern, secure protocols (**TLS 1.2** and **TLS 1.3**) should be enabled.

### 🔹 Finding 2: Support for Weak 3DES Cipher Suites (SWEET32 Attack)

**Identification:**  
The server supports multiple cipher suites using **3DES (Triple DES)**, all of which are graded 'C' by Nmap.  
The Nmap warnings explicitly flag this vulnerability: *64-bit block cipher 3DES vulnerable to SWEET32 attack.*

**Evidence Screenshot:**  
![3DES SWEET32 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20from%202025-11-04%2014-56-42.png)  
*This screenshot clearly shows the 3DES ciphers and the SWEET32 warning.*

**Impact (Medium Risk):**  
3DES uses a 64-bit block size, making it vulnerable to a **birthday attack** known as *SWEET32*.  
A persistent man-in-the-middle attacker can capture large volumes of traffic from a single connection to decrypt small, sensitive data, such as **session cookies or authentication tokens**.

**Root Cause:**  
The server's cipher suite list includes legacy ciphers that are no longer considered secure.

**Mitigation Strategy:**  
Update the server’s cipher suite configuration to remove all cipher suites containing 3DES (e.g., `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA`).  
The configuration should prioritize modern, strong ciphers such as **AES-GCM** or **CHACHA20-POLY1305**.
